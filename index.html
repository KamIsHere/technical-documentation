      <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support. It is also one of the
        core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS that you may have learned previously. This section will
        cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops.</p>

      <header>Comment Your JavaScript</header>
      <p>Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to
        leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.
        There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript: </p>
      <p>Using <code>//</code> will tell JavaScript to ignore the
        remainder of the text on the current line:</p>
      <code>// This is an in-line comment.</code>
      <p>You can make a multi-line comment beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code></p>
      <code>/* This is a </code><code>multi-line comment */</code>
      <h4>Best Practice</h4>
      <p>As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good
        commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self

      <p>In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different
        data types which are <code>undefined</code> ,
        <code>null</code> , <code>boolean</code> , <code>symbol</code> , <code>number</code> , <code>object</code></p>
      <p>For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number <code>"12"</code>, <code></code> </p>
