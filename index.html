        CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS.
        It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and
        rows, unlike
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">flexbox</a>
        which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by
        applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid
        Container) and to that element's children (which become Grid Items).

        CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system
        that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.
        CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it. First,
        we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks
        and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out,
        but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid
        actually
        work very well together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems
        we've
        all been hacking our way around for as long as we've been making websites.

        There are two primary things that inspired me to create this guide. The first is Rachel Andrew's awesome book <a
          href="https://abookapart.com/products/get-ready-for-css-grid-layout" target="_blank">Get Ready for CSS Grid
          Layout</a>. It's a thorough, clear introduction to Grid and is the basis of
        this entire article. I highly encourage you to buy it and read it. My
        other big inspiration is Chris Coyier's
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">A Complete Guide to
          Flexbox</a>, which has been my go-to resource for everything flexbox. It's
        helped a ton of people, evident by the fact that it's the top result
        when you Google "flexbox." You'll notice many similarities between his
        post and mine, because why not steal from the best?
      </p>

      <p class="text">My intention with this guide is to present the Grid concepts as they exist in the very latest
        version
        of the specification. So I won't be covering the out of date IE syntax, and I'll do my best to update this guide
        regularly
        as the spec matures.

      <p class="text">
        To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid,
        set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and
        then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row. Similarly
        to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter. Your CSS can place them
        in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media queries.
        Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging it to
        accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of
        the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.

      <p class="text">As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS
        Grid: Chrome (including on Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera.
        Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but it's an old implementation
        with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid is now!

      <header>Important Terminology</header>
      <p class="text">
        Before diving into the concepts of Grid it's important to understand the terminology.
        Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it's easy to confuse
        them with one another if you don't first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid
        specification. But don't worry, there aren't many of them.
      </p>

      <h2>Grid Container</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The element on which display: grid is applied. It's the direct parent of
        all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container.
      </p>
      <!-- <code>
          <div class="container">
              <div class="item item-1"></div>
              <div class="item item-2"></div>
              <div class="item item-3"></div>
            </div>
      </code> -->

      <h2>Grid Item</h2>
      <p class="text">The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container. 
        Here the item elements are grid items, but sub-item isn't.
