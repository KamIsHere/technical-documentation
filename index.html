        <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support. It is also one of the
          core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS that you may have learned previously. This section will
          cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Comment_Your_JavaScript">
        <header>Comment Your JavaScript</header>
        <p>Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to
          leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.
          There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript: </p>
        <p>Using <code>//</code> will tell JavaScript to ignore the
          remainder of the text on the current line:</p>
        <code>// This is an in-line comment.</code>
        <p>You can make a multi-line comment beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code></p>
        <code>/* This is a </code><code>multi-line comment */</code>
        <h4>Best Practice</h4>
        <p>As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good
          commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self
        </p>

        <header>Declare JavaScript Variables</header>
        <p>In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different
          data types which are <code>undefined</code> ,
          <code>null</code> , <code>boolean</code> , <code>symbol</code> , <code>number</code> , <code>object</code></p>
        <p>For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number <code>12</code> , and
          <code>strngs</code>
          , such as <code>"12"</code> , <code>"dog"</code> , or <CODE>"123 cats"</CODE> , which are collections of
          characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.</p>
        <p><i>Variables</i> allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a
          "label" to
          point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.
        </p>
        <p><code>variables</code> are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a
          simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer <code>variables</code> differ from
          mathematical
          variables in that they can store different values at different times.</p>
        <p>We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword <code>var</code> in front of it,
          like
          so:
        </p>
        <p><code>var ourName;</code></p>
        <p>creates a <code>variable</code> called <code>ourName</code>. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.
        </p>
        <p><code>Variable</code> names can be made up of numbers, letters, and <code>$</code> or <code>_</code>, but may
          not contain spaces or start with a number.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Storing_Values_With_The_Assignment_Operator">
        <header>Storing Values With The Assignment Operator</header>
        <p>In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the <i>assignment</i> operator.</p>
        <p><code>myVariable = 5;</code></p>
        <p>This assigns the <code>Number</code> value <code>5</code> to <code>myVariable</code>.</p>
        <p>Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the <code>=</code> operator is resolved
          before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.</p>
        <p><code>myVar = 5;</code></p>
        <p><code>myNum = myVar;</code></p>
        <p>This assigns <code>5</code> to <code>myVar</code> and then resolves <code>myVar</code> to <code>5</code>
          again
          and assigns it to <code>myNum</code>.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Initializing_Variables_With_The_Assignment_Operator">
        <header>Initializing Variables With The Assignment Operator</header>
        <p>It is common to <i>initialize</i> a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.</p>
        <p><code>var myVar = 0;</code></p>
        <p>Creates a new variable called <code>myVar</code> and assigns it an initial value of <code>0</code>.</p>
