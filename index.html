          CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS.
          It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and
          rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work
          with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which
          becomes the Grid Container) and to that element's children (which
          become Grid Items).

          CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout
          system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we
          design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to lay out
          our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it. First, we
          used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of
          these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important
          functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out,
          but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex
          two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well
          together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to
          solve the layout problems we've all been hacking our way around for as
          long as we've been making websites. There are two primary things that
          inspired me to create this guide. The first is Rachel Andrew's awesome
          book Get Ready for CSS Grid Layout. It's a thorough, clear
          introduction to Grid and is the basis of this entire article. I highly
          encourage you to buy it and read it. My other big inspiration is Chris
          Coyier's A Complete Guide to Flexbox, which has been my go-to resource
          for everything flexbox. It's helped a ton of people, evident by the
          fact that it's the top result when you Google "flexbox." You'll notice
          many similarities between his post and mine, because why not steal
          from the best? My intention with this guide is to present the Grid
          concepts as they exist in the very latest version of the
          specification. So I won't be covering the out of date IE syntax, and
          I'll do my best to update this guide regularly as the spec matures.

          To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with
          display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns
          and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the
          grid with grid-column and grid-row. Similarly to flexbox, the source
          order of the grid items doesn't matter. Your CSS can place them in any
          order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media
          queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then
          completely rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all
          with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS
          modules ever introduced. As of March 2017, most browsers shipped
          native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on
          Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet
          Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but it's an old
          implementation with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid is
          now!
